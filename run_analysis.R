#Collect, work with, and clean a data set
#Prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
#You will be required to submit: 
#1) a tidy data set as described below, 
#2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
#3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
#4) You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

#Wearable computing: Accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

#You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
#Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
#From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
